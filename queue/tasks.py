This file defines the three background tasks that Celery runs.
The three tasks run in order:
    1. process_medical_report  → reads the image and extracts lab values (OCR)
    2. predict_disease_risk    → runs the ML model on those lab values
    3. compare_reports         → compares two reports side by side
